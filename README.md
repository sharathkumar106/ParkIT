# PARKIT

## An Internship Project

The system provides the user with an option to either go with a post-paid or pre-paid option. User can opt for either of these based on their requirements. The system will be user-centered as they can view and reserve the available slots by themselves. This system can be useful for the regular customers of a place and for the one-time visitors. The main contribution of our proposed systems is to find out the status of the parking area, reserve the spot for required period of time and manage the payments effectively.
